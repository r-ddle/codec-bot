# üöÄ Phases 1-3 Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What We've Implemented

### **Phase 1: Database Extensions** ‚úÖ

**New File:** `src/database/extensions.py`

- Created `DatabaseExtensions` class to manage new feature tables
- Added 4 new tables (does NOT touch existing `member_data` table):
  - `shop_items` - Store shop items (boosters, cosmetics)
  - `member_inventory` - Track member purchases
  - `active_boosters` - Track active XP boosters
  - `mission_progress` - Track mission progress (prepared for Phase 5)
- Safe initialization - only creates tables if they don't exist
- Integrated with bot startup in `bot_instance.py`

**Database Safety:**
- ‚úÖ Existing `member_data` table is NOT modified
- ‚úÖ New tables are separate and optional
- ‚úÖ Old member data is completely safe
- ‚úÖ Can be disabled via feature flags

---

### **Phase 2: Slash Commands** ‚úÖ

**Updated File:** `src/cogs/slash_commands.py`

**New Slash Commands:**
- `/rank [user]` - View detailed rank card with XP progress
- `/daily` - Claim daily bonus (with rank-up notifications)
- `/leaderboard [type]` - View top 10 by XP, GMP, or messages
- `/status` - Quick status check (existing, kept)
- `/ping` - Connection test (existing, kept)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- ‚úÖ All existing `!` commands still work
- ‚úÖ Both `/` and `!` versions available
- ‚úÖ Same functionality, just better UI
- ‚úÖ Old users can keep using `!` commands

---

### **Phase 3: Shop Backend** ‚úÖ

**New File:** `src/utils/shop.py`

**Features Implemented:**
- `ShopSystem` class with complete shop logic
- Purchase items with GMP currency
- Inventory management system
- Booster activation system
- XP multiplier tracking (2x boosters)
- Automatic expired booster cleanup

**Shop Items (4 Boosters):**
1. **XP Booster 2x (1 hour)** - 300 GMP
2. **XP Booster 2x (24 hours)** - 2,000 GMP
3. **Daily Bonus Multiplier** - 500 GMP
4. **XP Booster 2x (1 week)** - 5,000 GMP

**Admin Commands for Testing:** (in `src/cogs/admin.py`)
- `!shop_init` - Initialize shop items in database
- `!shop_list` - View all shop items
- `!shop_test_buy <item_id>` - Test purchasing an item
- `!shop_test_inventory [member]` - View member's inventory
- `!shop_test_activate <inventory_id>` - Test activating a booster
- `!shop_give_gmp <member> <amount>` - Give GMP for testing

**XP Multiplier Integration:**
- Updated `src/events/message_events.py` to apply multipliers
- XP from messages and tactical words is multiplied
- Only applies when `ENABLE_XP_BOOSTERS` feature flag is True
- Default multiplier is 1.0 (no boost)

---

### **Phase 0: Feature Flags** ‚úÖ

**Updated File:** `src/config/settings.py`

**Added Configuration:**
```python
BOT_VERSION = "2.0.0-alpha"
MIGRATION_VERSION = 1

FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    'ENABLE_SHOP': False,              # GMP shop (Phase 3/4)
    'ENABLE_MISSIONS': False,          # Daily missions (Phase 5)
    'ENABLE_SLASH_COMMANDS': True,     # Slash commands (Phase 2)
    'ENABLE_ACHIEVEMENTS': False,      # Achievements (Phase 6)
    'ENABLE_XP_BOOSTERS': False,       # XP multipliers (Phase 3)
}
```

**Safety Features:**
- All new features disabled by default
- Can be enabled individually
- Shop system checks flag before running
- XP boosters check flag before applying
- Old functionality works regardless of flags

---

## üîß How to Test

### **Step 1: Start the Bot**

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Tom\Documents\GitHub\txrails
.venv\Scripts\activate
python src/bot.py
```

The bot will automatically:
- Initialize new database tables (if Neon is connected)
- Keep all existing data intact
- Start with all new features disabled

---

### **Step 2: Test Slash Commands** ‚úÖ SAFE TO TEST NOW

These work immediately and don't affect old data:

```
/ping           - Test connection
/status         - Quick status
/rank           - View your rank
/rank @User     - View someone's rank
/daily          - Claim daily bonus
/leaderboard    - View XP leaderboard
/leaderboard type:GMP - View GMP leaderboard
```

**Old commands still work:**
```
!rank
!daily
!gmp
etc.
```

‚úÖ **Both systems work side-by-side!**

---

### **Step 3: Test Shop System** (Admin Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Shop is DISABLED by default** - must enable manually

**3a. Enable Shop (in `settings.py`):**
```python
FEATURE_FLAGS = {
    'ENABLE_SHOP': True,        # ‚Üê Change to True
    'ENABLE_XP_BOOSTERS': True, # ‚Üê Change to True
}
```

**3b. Restart bot and initialize shop:**
```
!shop_init
```

**3c. View shop items:**
```
!shop_list
```

**3d. Give yourself GMP for testing:**
```
!shop_give_gmp @YourName 5000
```

**3e. Test purchasing:**
```
!shop_test_buy 1    (Buy item ID 1)
```

**3f. View your inventory:**
```
!shop_test_inventory
```

**3g. Activate a booster:**
```
!shop_test_activate <inventory_id>
```

**3h. Test XP multiplier:**
- Send messages - you should get double XP!
- Check with `!rank` to see XP increase faster

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Safety Guarantees

### **What We DIDN'T Touch:**

‚úÖ **Existing `member_data.json`** - Unchanged
‚úÖ **Existing Neon `member_data` table** - Unchanged
‚úÖ **Member XP, GMP, ranks** - All preserved
‚úÖ **Member statistics** - All preserved
‚úÖ **Old commands** - All still work

### **What We ADDED:**

‚úÖ **New database tables** (separate from member_data)
‚úÖ **Slash command alternatives** (old commands still work)
‚úÖ **Shop system** (disabled by default, opt-in)
‚úÖ **Feature flags** (safe enable/disable)

---

## üéÆ For Your Members

**Nothing Changes Unless You Enable It!**

1. **All old commands work exactly the same**
2. **All member data is preserved**
3. **New slash commands are optional** (old ! commands still work)
4. **Shop is disabled** until you're ready
5. **XP boosters are disabled** until you enable them

**When you enable shop:**
- Old members keep all their GMP
- They can spend GMP on boosters
- Boosters are optional - they don't have to buy anything
- Everything is additive, nothing is taken away

}
```

### **Rollback Database (if needed):**
```sql
-- Run in Neon console if needed
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mission_progress;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS active_boosters;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS member_inventory;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS shop_items;
```

### **Old data is safe!**
