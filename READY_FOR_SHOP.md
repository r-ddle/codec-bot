# üéØ MAJOR ISSUES FIXED - READY FOR SHOP IMPROVEMENTS

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES (8 Critical Issues)

### üîí Security & Stability
1. **Fixed Bare Exception Handlers** - All `except:` replaced with specific exceptions
2. **Added Rate Limiting** - Prevents command spam/abuse (new `rate_limiter.py`)
3. **Memory Leak Fixed** - Codec conversations & rate limits cleaned up hourly
4. **Async HTTP** - Intel command no longer blocks event loop

### üêõ Exploit Fixes
5. **Tactical Word Exploit** - No more double-dipping, cooldown enforced
6. **XP Booster Stacking** - Only ONE active booster allowed (was stackable to 10x+)
7. **Voice Activity Bug** - Fixed muted users getting XP
8. **Timezone Exploit** - Daily bonus uses UTC (prevents manipulation)

## üìä FILES MODIFIED
- `src/core/bot_instance.py` - Memory leak fixes, cleanup tasks
- `src/events/message_events.py` - Tactical word cooldown fix
- `src/cogs/moderation.py` - Exception handling
- `src/cogs/progression.py` - Rate limiting on !daily, !gmp
- `src/cogs/shop_commands.py` - Rate limiting on shop commands
- `src/cogs/intel.py` - Async HTTP, proper error handling
- `src/database/member_data.py` - UTC timezone fix
- `src/utils/daily_supply_gen.py` - Exception handling
- `src/utils/shop.py` - Anti-stacking for boosters
- **NEW**: `src/utils/rate_limiter.py` - Rate limiting system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED

**SECURITY NOTICE**: Your Discord token is exposed in `.env` and git history!

**Read `SECURITY_NOTICE.md` for steps to:**
1. Regenerate Discord bot token
2. Rotate database credentials
3. Clean git history
4. Secure your bot

## üöÄ NEXT: IMPROVED SHOP SYSTEM

Now that critical bugs are fixed, we can build a better shop system:

### Phase 1: Transaction Safety ‚úÖ READY
- Atomic purchases (GMP deduction + inventory addition)
- Rollback on failure
- Proper error handling

### Phase 2: Shop Features üéØ NEXT
- Categories (weapons, items, boosters, cosmetics)
- Item rarity system (common, rare, legendary)
- Limited-time offers / sales
- Bundle deals
- Gift system (send items to other users)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- User trade system
- Auction house
- Craft/upgrade system
- Achievement rewards

### Phase 4: UI Improvements
- Pagination for large inventories
- Search/filter system
- Preview before purchase
- Purchase history
- Wishlist feature

## üß™ TEST BEFORE DEPLOYING

```bash
# Test rate limiting
!daily
!daily  # Should show cooldown

# Test shop
!shop
!buy 1
!inventory
!use 1  # Should prevent stacking

# Test voice XP
# Join voice channel muted - should NOT get XP

# Test tactical words
"infiltrate the base stealth tactical"  # Only counts once per cooldown
```
