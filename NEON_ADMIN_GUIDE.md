- Member count for each backup

---

### `!neon_backup`

### `!neon_resync` ‚≠ê NEW
**Force a complete resync with rank recalculation.**

**Usage:**
```
!neon_resync
```

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Reloads data from `member_data.json` (ensures latest data)
2. ‚úÖ Recalculates ALL ranks based on current XP
3. ‚úÖ Fixes any rank inconsistencies
4. ‚úÖ Syncs corrected data to Neon database
5. ‚úÖ Records backup in history

**When to use:**
- After noticing incorrect ranks in database
- When you want to ensure Neon has the absolute latest data
- After manual edits to member_data.json
- To fix rank discrepancies

**Note:** This is safe to run anytime. It will not lose data.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Date format errors in logs
**Error:** `'str' object has no attribute 'toordinal'`

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
- Added automatic date parsing in neon_db.py
- Converts string dates to PostgreSQL date objects
- Handles None values gracefully

### Issue: Inaccurate ranks in Neon
**Problem:** Members' ranks in database don't match their XP

**Solution:**
```
!neon_resync
```

This will:
1. Load the latest member_data.json
2. Recalculate every member's rank based on their XP
3. Update Neon with corrected data

### Issue: Database not syncing
**Check:**
1. Verify `NEON_DATABASE_URL` is in .env file
2. Run `!neon_status` to check connection
3. Check bot.log for errors

---

## üìä How Syncing Works

### Automatic Syncing
Every time the bot saves data (auto-save, manual save), it:
1. Saves to local JSON file first
2. Then syncs to Neon database (if connected)

### Manual Syncing
Use `!neon_backup` or `!neon_resync` to manually trigger sync.

### Data Priority
- **JSON file** is always the source of truth
- **Neon database** is a backup/cloud copy
- On startup, bot loads from JSON file
- Changes are synced to both locations

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### Regular Backups
```
!neon_backup    # Run weekly or after major events
```

### After Data Fixes
```
!neon_resync    # Run after fixing ranks or member data
```

### Monitoring
```
!neon_status    # Check regularly to ensure syncing
```

## üìù Backup History

The bot tracks all backups with:
- Timestamp
- Number of members backed up
- Number of guilds
- Backup type (full_backup, full_backup_with_rank_fix)
- Status (success/failure)

View history with: `!neon_status`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **JSON is Primary**: The local `member_data.json` is always the source of truth
2. **Neon is Backup**: The cloud database is for backup and 24/7 hosting
3. **Safe to Resync**: `!neon_resync` is safe to run anytime
4. **No Data Loss**: All operations preserve your data
5. **Rank Recalculation**: Based on XP thresholds in constants.py

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix Guide

**Problem:** Ranks look wrong in database
```
!neon_resync
```

**Problem:** Want to ensure latest data is backed up
```
!neon_resync
```

**Problem:** Made manual changes to member_data.json
```

Already fixed! Just restart the bot.
```
